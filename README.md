### Process:
#### Implementing RSA Cryptosystem.  &larr; In Progress... 
**Side Quest:** 
* My Miller-Rabin algorithm is incredibly slow. I need to deterministically pick new random values without repetition.
  * The problem was not the algorithm but that I attempted to apply it to generate primes. Which is not what it is meant for! 
* Implement Sieve of Erastothenes to generate primes!



#### Algorithms for Discrete Logarithm calculation. 
#### Digital Signature protocols.
