### Implementing RSA Cryptosystem.  &larr; In Progress... 
### Process...:
1. Started implementing RSA.
2. Decided that I want to program an algorithm that will produce prime numbers up to n for me.
   1. I found Miller-Rabin test, which is not for generating primes but for testing a given number if it's a prime. 
      1. *Comment:* Using a number testing algorithm to generate a list of primes gave me a proper headache. I need to learn to research more before jumping into implementing.
   2. I searched for effective prime generation algorithms and "Sieve of Eratosthenes" came up. 
      1. *Comment:* Still I did not use as much time as I would like to ensure that I am implementing the algorithm correctly. 
3. **Next &rarr;** Use the Sieve of Erastothenes to generate the primes to use in RSA.



### Coming next:
#### Implement the Miller-Rabin test, and use it to check if a large number is a prime.
#### Algorithms for Discrete Logarithm calculation. 
#### Digital Signature protocols.
